There are two main files in this project: runner.py and minesweeper.py. 
minesweeper.py contains all of the logic the game itself and for the AI to play the game. 
runner.py contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.
you should be able to run python runner.py to play Minesweeper (or let your AI play for you)!
When you run your AI (as by clicking “AI Move”), note that it will not always win! There will be some cases where the AI must guess, because it lacks sufficient information to make a safe move. This is to be expected. runner.py will print whether the AI is making a move it believes to be safe or whether it is making a random move.
